# -UAV-Tracking-Using-Kalman-Extended-Kalman-and-Unscented-Kalman-Filters-FPGA-Implementation-
his repository contains three FPGA-ready implementations of state estimation filters — Kalman Filter (KF), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) — designed for 3D UAV tracking in XYZ space. Each filter uses a MATLAB-generated trajectory and has its own trajectory generator, HLS implementation, and testbench.
